# Password Management Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Implemented Secure Password Management**
   - Created a complete authentication system with proper password hashing using bcrypt
   - Added password salt generation and secure comparison
   - Implemented token-based authentication system
   - Added support for two-factor authentication
   - Created secure password update and reset functionality

2. **API Implementation**
   - Created a full set of authentication endpoints:
     - `/api/auth/login` - User login with email/password
     - `/api/auth/two-factor` - Two-factor authentication verification 
     - `/api/auth/logout` - User logout and token invalidation
     - `/api/auth/refresh-token` - Token refresh functionality
   - Added password-related endpoints:
     - `/api/users/:id/password` - Update user password
     - `/api/users/:id/reset-password` - Reset user password

3. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed documentation on the password management implementation
   - Updated security documentation to reference the new implementation
   - Updated API documentation to include authentication endpoints

4. **Security Features**
   - Passwords are never stored in plain text
   - Each password is hashed with a unique salt
   - Token-based authentication with 24-hour expiry
   - Proper error handling for authentication operations
   - Secure token invalidation on logout

5. **Testing**
   - Tested user creation with password hashing
   - Tested login with correct and incorrect credentials
   - Tested token validation and invalidation
   - Tested password reset and update functionality

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Add Password Complexity Requirements**
   - Implement minimum length, character types, etc.
   - Add password strength meter on the frontend

2. **Enhance Token Security**
   - Consider using JWT instead of UUID tokens
   - Implement token refreshing with refresh tokens
   - Add more robust token invalidation on sensitive operations

3. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - Implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts

4. **Add Advanced Security Features**
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement password expiration policy
   - Add support for hardware security keys (WebAuthn)
   - Consider passwordless authentication options

5. **Improve User Experience**
   - Add password recovery via email
   - Implement "remember me" functionality
   - Add login notifications for suspicious activity
   - Provide a login history view for users
